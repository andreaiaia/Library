# Library
Project Library, from the odin project

I made a simple site that displays all the objects in the myLibrary array.
The project includes a button to add new entries, a button to delete one entry, and it uses localStorage to save the library into the user's pc.

### Skills acquired
The project is a way to practice with the newly studied arguments of Objects and Objects Constructors.
